# soehi/gguf

Read-only GGUF container parsing and ggml block dequantization, in pure
MoonBit. No FFI, no third-party dependencies; builds and tests on `native`
and `wasm-gc`.

This is the container + numeric layer of the MoonLM project, split out so it
can be reused on its own: anything that needs to open a GGUF and get floats
out of it can depend on this module without also taking the inference engine,
the tokenizer, or the agent runtime.

## Packages

| Import | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `soehi/gguf` | The GGUF container: header, metadata key/values, tensor directory. |
| `soehi/gguf/tensor` | The ggml type table (all 43 ids) and block dequantization kernels. |

## Scope

**Read-only parsing.** Given a `Bytes` holding a GGUF file, you get the
version, the alignment, every metadata key/value, and the tensor directory
(name, dims, type, offset, element count, byte size). No file I/O is
performed here — the buffer comes from the caller, which is what lets this
package work unchanged on a browser, where there is no filesystem.

**Dequantization to f32.** Six block types are decoded: f32, f16, q4_0,
q5_0, q8_0, q4_K, q6_K. Every kernel is a line-by-line transcription of the
matching `dequantize_row_*` in llama.cpp's `ggml/src/ggml-quants.c`, with
byte offsets taken from the `block_*` structs in `ggml/src/ggml-common.h`.
The expected values in the golden tests were produced by an independent numpy
reference and asserted to round-trip, so agreement is evidence rather than
tautology.

**Bounded failure.** A malformed container returns a named error with an
offset, never a trap. A short or misaligned payload is rejected rather than
truncated. A type this build cannot decode is reported by name, with its
block size still computed correctly so a directory listing stays usable.

## Non-goals

These are deliberately absent, and adding any of them would be a feature
request rather than a bug fix:

- **Writing GGUF.** This module does not produce files. Serializing a
  container needs a policy for alignment and metadata ordering that the
  reader cannot infer.
- **Quantization.** Only dequantization. Producing q4_0/q5_0 blocks means
  choosing a quantization objective, which is a different problem with a
  different set of tradeoffs.
- **Inference.** No matvec, no attention, no sampling. The consumer supplies
  the arithmetic; this module stops at "give me the numbers for this block".
- **Tokenizer, model config, or engine glue.** Those live in the MoonLM
  module and are what depend on this one, not the other way round.

## Verification

- Golden vectors per block type, at 1e-6 relative tolerance, on both targets.
- Cross-checked against llama.cpp's own Python `gguf` reader on real models
  (header, all metadata, the complete tensor directory, and decoded values).
- Malformed-input coverage: truncation at many offsets, byte-level mutation,
  and one hand-aimed case per parser guard.

See `docs/gguf-notes.md` for the byte layouts, the type table, and the
implementation notes.

## Maintenance

Maintained by **soehi** (the MoonLM author) until this module has an
independent issue tracker.

- **Semver.** Breaking changes bump the major version. Within a major
  version, new dequantizable types and new metadata helpers are additive and
  land in a minor; bug fixes and error-message improvements land in a patch.
- **Issues.** Please file them in the
  [moonlm](https://github.com/soehi/moonlm) repository until this module gets
  its own tracker. Prefix the title with `gguf:` so it can be found.
- **License.** Apache-2.0, same as MoonLM.
